  <h1>Challenge 4's Example Explained</h1>

  Angular is a bit more complicated than React, and fundamentally different. Angular is a framework, more like Express, while React is a library.
  
  Technically, you can use React in Angular, but why would you?.
  
  
  
  <h2>Let's figure out what went on in challlenge 4</h2>
  <h3><b>CONFIGURING OUR PORT</b></h3>

  If you read the docs correctly, you'll have figured out that this happens in angular.json or using  <code style="background: pink;">ng serve --port</code>. Basically,
  
  the docs say that any <code style="background: pink;">option</code> in <code style="background: pink;">ng serve --&lt;option&gt;</code> can be included in the serve block as a property.
  
  So instead of using <code style="background: pink;">ng serve --port 8001</code>, I've set "port": 8001 in the serve block in the angular.json file.

  <code style="background: pink; display: block;">
    "serve": {{'{'}}
    "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server",
    "options": {{'{'}}
    "browserTarget": "mern-stack-guide-client:build",
    "port": 8001
    {{'}'}},
    ...
  </code>

  ðŸŒŸ If you figured that out by using the Angular docs, welldone, you know how to read docs.

  <h3><b>WHERE DOES OUR APP START?</b></h3>

  At main.ts
  
  - main.ts imports AppModule.
  - AppModule imports AppComponent.
  - AppComponent selects app-root as it's containing element.
  - AppComponent renders it's template: app.component.html, in &lt;app-root&gt;&lt;/app-root&gt;.
  - Can you find app-root in index.html?

  <h3><b>Okay, there's a bit more: css and assets</b></h3>

  In order to access global context css and assets in our index.html or our component templates, we need to tell webpack (read angular) where to find them.

  We do that in the angular.json config file, within the architect block. Take a look:
  
  <code style="background: pink; display: block;">
      "architect": {{'{'}}
        "build": {{'{'}}
          ...
          "options": {{'{'}}
            ...
            "assets": [
            "src/assets"
            ],
            "styles": [
            "src/styles.css"
            ],
            "scripts": []
      },
  </code>

  Here, we're saying that webpack should include the files src/assets, and src/styles.css in the global context for use in our angular app.
  
  The <a href="https://angular.io/guide/workspace-config#default-build-targets">angluar doc has more on this</a>

  And that's about it for explanations.
