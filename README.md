This is the client code repo for a GADS guided project supported by [@manimanis](https://github.com/manimanis) and [@nnadozie](https://github.com/Nnadozie), and open to more example solutions and course recommendations from mentors.

### Brief: Build an uber.com homepage with the select preferred language feature.
* Using the Google translate API is not allowed.


* Assume a translator was employed to translate the text into different languages and provided you the output in txt format.


* You have to be able to save and update this text to a dB (either mongodb or postgres) using post or put requests.


* The text must be retrieved using get requests, in JSON format and used to populate the homepage.


* There can be no hard-coded text on the homepage.





Here's what to expect:



* We'll be using an example, challenge structure.

* Note: the examples are in no way ideal solutions, but they are intentionally barebone for easy comprehension.

* That is. It's structured as a series of small-sized challenges, and you'll be given examples along with the challenges.


* I hope this will prompt learners to ask questions and figure out a lot of things on your own.


* We're starting with backend challenges, before moving to the front end.


There'll be personally reviewed recommended courses that help guide you along. You can expect that we'd have done these courses to assess them before recommending.

### Challenge 4 (Rating: Easy)

It's front-end time! Here's where things get exciting ^_^, and also a good time to start brushing up on your CSS!

* Create a react-app or an angular-app and get it running in development mode on localhost:8081 or any other port of your choice.
* It should display any valid html/css of your choice. I recommend a simple "hello world, my name is <name>"
  
Why do this challenge?
* The idea behind this challenge is to get you to read the react/angular docs, by asking you to configure your port. 

* Sure, you'll easily find out how to do this on Stackoverflow, but if you can challenge yourself to figure it out using just their docs, then you've learned a transferable skill.

Recommended
* For react: [getting-started-with-react](https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/), [create-react-app advanced configuration](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/advanced-configuration)
* If you choose Angular: [Angular Fundamentals sections 1-2](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/angular-fundamentals/table-of-contents), [Angular Workspace Configuration](https://angular.io/guide/workspace-config)
